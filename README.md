# yearlymileage
Calculate mileage driven in a year and tax credit calculation
Thanks so much to the homie who helped me out with this over in the phillipines. It made me feel excited to know that i have made a bit of progress in python. 
I will continue to develope this code with graphics and then also so it can catch the exceptions as when i used it, and would make a mistake it would not save the already 
inputed miles. Also I would like for it to save as the year progresses so that i can keep total track of my miles per month/week/day even year. Stay tuned for 
more coding to be done.
